# Filarr Gate documentation

[Lire en français](README.fr.md)

Filarr Gate serves the Filarr databases you choose as an API, from a copy it decrypts itself, on your side, without
Filarr ever seeing your data. Start with the [README](../README.md) for the idea in two minutes.

Every code block of the tutorials is copied from [examples/](../examples), and every example runs in the test suite
against a gate before each release (`npm run test:examples`). The tables of settings, commands and codes are generated
from the code (`npm run docs:check` fails when they drift).

**No Filarr account?** `npm run mock-filarr` starts an in-memory Filarr with three demo databases and prints a token:
enough to follow every tutorial.

## Use cases, complete and tested

| example | the case |
|---|---|
| [first-calls](../examples/first-calls) | the API in curl, JavaScript and Python, with pagination, idempotent writes and `429` |
| [library-node](../examples/library-node) | `@filarr/gate` in a service: read, listen, write, stop cleanly |
| [webhook-receiver](../examples/webhook-receiver) | a signed webhook checked and acted on, in Node and Python |
| [static-site](../examples/static-site) | a catalogue page built from a view and rebuilt on each change |
| [erp-orders-invoices](../examples/erp-orders-invoices) | an ERP that writes its orders once (idempotent batch) and drops its invoices into a folder |
| [receive-files](../examples/receive-files) | depositing files with curl and Python, following their status |
| [python-nightly-export](../examples/python-nightly-export) | a nightly CSV export by SQL |
| [mcp-assistant](../examples/mcp-assistant) | an AI assistant reading your databases over MCP (stdio and HTTP) |
| [public-form](../examples/public-form) | a public form that can only add rows, from one web page |
| [sync-d1](../examples/sync-d1) | a D1 table synced in every direction, with the four conflict policies |
| [sync-postgres](../examples/sync-postgres) | a PostgreSQL of the local network, with a limited role |
| [docker](../examples/docker) | Docker Compose behind Caddy |

## Vocabulary

The words of this documentation are those of the Filarr app and its help: a **database** (a Filarr database), an
**access** (what "Open to an API…" creates), its **token** (`flr_live_…`), an **app key** (`gk_…`, one per program),
the file **slot**, the **"ask me" queue** of conflicts, the **guard** that stops a sync pass. The full vocabulary is in
Filarr's help: [Gate vocabulary](https://filarr.com/en/docs/gate-glossary).
