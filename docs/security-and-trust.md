# Security and trust: who sees what

[Lire en français](security-and-trust.fr.md)

Filarr encrypts your notes and databases end to end: its servers store blocks they cannot read. To serve a database
as an API, something must decrypt it. This page says exactly what does, in each mode, who can therefore read what, and
what is guaranteed by encryption, what can be checked, and what rests on commitments only. Where a limit exists, it is
written here.

## The three modes

| | where the gate runs | who holds the token | the opened databases decrypted by Filarr's servers? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **In your code, on your machine** (library, Node, Docker) | your computer, your server | you | **no** |
| **On your Cloudflare account** | a Worker and a Durable Object of YOUR account | you (a Worker secret) | **no** (Cloudflare, as your host, is in the same position as for any Worker you run) |
| **Hosted by Filarr** (paid option, open since October 27, 2026) | a service of Filarr | that service, sealed | **yes**, for the databases you entrust to it and while they stay entrusted |

## Who sees what, at home (the first two modes)

| party | sees | never sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Filarr's servers** | the access (its id, its public key, the fingerprint of its proof), the sealed keys and the sealed views (which they cannot open), counters (requests, downloaded bytes, commits), the gate's IP address and version | the token, the keys it derives, a database key, a row, a column name |
| **The gate, and whoever runs it** | every row and every column of the databases opened to the access, not only what the views show | a database that is not opened to it, your other notes, files, vaults, your account's keys |
| **Your software** | what its app key allows (a database, a view, a query, SQL, files) | the Filarr token |
| **A webhook receiver** | the rows (and fields) its webhook selects, signed | anything else |
| **An external database** (a sync) | the gate's IP address, the operations of the sync | Filarr's other data |
| **The members of a vault** | the definition of a sync (without key), its state and its journal, values it replaced included | the key of the external database |

**A view is a convenience, not a boundary.** The gate reads the whole database it is given; a view only shapes what an
endpoint returns. To share less, open a database that holds less.

## What protects what

**By encryption**

- **The token opens only the databases you chose.** It is `flr_live_<id>_<secret>`. From the secret, the gate derives
  (HKDF-SHA256) the proof it shows Filarr and a private key; Filarr stores only the fingerprint of the proof and the
  public key. A stolen request log at Filarr opens nothing.
- **One key per database and per generation.** Each database key is derived one way from your root key, for one
  database and one generation, and sealed to the access's public key. It cannot be turned back into your root key, nor
  into the next generation, nor into another database's key.
- **Revocation cuts the future.** Revoking an access (or removing a database from it) moves each database to a new
  generation whose key is never sealed to the old token: what is written afterwards is unreadable to it, even if
  encrypted blocks leaked some other way.
- **Nothing is accepted from the wrong place.** Every sealed key names its access, database and generation, and the
  gate refuses one found elsewhere. Every block is checked against the database head's fingerprints before it is
  decrypted; a server that goes back in time is refused.
- **Signed objects come from the creator, not from a server.** Deposit boxes, sync definitions and migration targets
  are accepted only when signed by the access creator's identity key, which the gate authenticates with a tag only the
  token can compute. A server that served its own key would be refused: files would not be sealed for it, a changed
  sync definition would not run.
- **Files are sealed before they leave.** The gate encrypts each file with a fresh key, sealed to your deposit box;
  Filarr stores what it cannot open, and learns neither the name nor the folder.

**By the gate's design**

- Decrypted rows live **in memory only**. On disk (state directory, files mode 0600 where the system allows): the
  token (unless given by the environment), the fingerprints of the app keys, the webhook secrets, the management
  password's hash (scrypt), the settings, the encrypted blocks exactly as Filarr stores them (unless `cache = memory`),
  the keys of external databases encrypted under a key derived from the token, the encrypted state of the syncs, and
  the local log (paths, codes, durations; no row content, no token, no key).
- **Never on disk**: a database key, a decrypted row, a webhook body (pending deliveries live in memory).
- **Never on the network**: the token or its secret.
- Your software never holds the token: each program has its own app key, stored as a fingerprint, limited to its
  endpoints, with a rate, allowed addresses and an expiry.
- Revocation wipes the copy, the keys and the block cache of a gate that hears it.
- The management UI asks for a password (ten characters at least), listens on `127.0.0.1` by default, refuses writes
  without its own header (a page of another site cannot forge it), and limits wrong passwords.

**What is not guaranteed, said plainly**

- **Whoever runs the gate, or knows its management password, reads the opened databases.** Protect the machine as you
  would the data.
- **A gate that was offline keeps its copy** until it reconnects and hears the revocation, or until someone erases it
  on its machine.
- **Replacing a token does not change the keys** (revoking does). See [revoke](tutorials/revoke.md).
- **Webhooks carry rows in clear** to your receiver: use HTTPS, and verify the signature.
- **Two-way syncs to Airtable, Google Sheets and Notion** cannot write "only if the value is still the one I read":
  the gate re-reads just before writing, and a window of less than a second remains in which a change made in the
  source at that instant could be overwritten (and kept in the journal). D1, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Supabase have no
  such window.
- **"The most recent wins"** compares the clocks of two machines, and dates the row, not the cell.
- **The Cloudflare variant**: Cloudflare, as the host of your Worker, runs your code and could technically reach its
  memory, as for any Worker.

## Hosted by Filarr

> Open since October 27, 2026, on the Pro, Teams and Enterprise plans: 4 € a month or 48 € a year per box, one box
> included per Teams or Enterprise organization. This section describes it as the frozen contract `gate-heberge-1`
> fixes it. An internal security review is done; the external review is planned. The
> [trust page](https://filarr.com/en/trust#trust-hosted) and the [hosted box DPA
> annex](https://filarr.com/en/legal/dpa/hosted) are on Filarr's website. Managing the app keys and webhooks of a hosted
> box is coming in a future version of Filarr's apps.

For the databases you **entrust** to it, and while they stay entrusted, a service of Filarr manages their key and runs
the same Filarr Gate: those databases are no longer end-to-end encrypted. Filarr will use one expression only: a
database "entrusted to Filarr", a box "hosted by Filarr".

### What is no longer end-to-end encrypted

| what | decrypted by | why |
|---|---|---|
| every row and every column of the entrusted databases, viewed or not | the hosted service | it manages their keys and serves the API from its copy |
| what is written to them while they stay entrusted (by you, the members, the API) | the hosted service | the current generation is sealed to it while the database stays entrusted |
| the requests of your software and the answers | the hosted service | it serves the API |
| the same requests and answers, **in transit** | the Cloudflare account that manages filarr.com, the one of Filarr's API, which also hosts the service | the box's address `<name>.gate.filarr.com` is a name of its zone: it terminates TLS itself |
| the key of an external database connected to the box, and its rows | the hosted service | the scheduled sync runs there |
| the files the box receives, in passing | the hosted service | it seals them for your deposit box after receiving them |

Filarr's API itself handles, as at home, encrypted blocks, sealed keys and counters, and the token sealed for the
service, which it cannot open (it is sealed to the service's key, which the apps carry built in).

What is not affected: the databases you did not entrust, your notes, files and vaults; your root keys (a database key
is derived one way); what is written after you take the key back (the generation changes, the new key is never sealed
to the service, and those databases are end-to-end encrypted again); the folder where your received files are filed
(only your devices file them).

### What protects, ranked by strength

| strength | protection | its exact limit |
|---|---|---|
| encryption | one database, not the account | the entrusted key opens one database at one generation |
| encryption | taking the key back cuts the future | what the service processed BEFORE is covered by commitments only |
| encryption | the token is never in clear in the API's database or its backups | it does not cover the traffic in transit, nor the service itself, which holds its private key |
| none | the traffic of a hosted box, in transit | not end-to-end encrypted: the account that manages filarr.com terminates TLS and decrypts it; said in the consent |
| verifiable | the code fingerprint the service announces equals the published version's | this checks what the service announces; Workers offer no remote attestation, so it does not prove that the running code is that code. Hence the security reviews (internal done, external planned), the public log of releases, and the commitment |
| verifiable | everything is traced | consent, service versions, sleep, take-back, erasure receipt, in the access's log |
| verifiable | it shows | everyone who sees an entrusted database sees the mark, on every device |
| commitment | isolation, no logging of content, copies in the EU, no other use | these are commitments, not protection by encryption: Cloudflare, as host, runs the machines where the service decrypts the data; a request crosses the point of presence nearest to the caller, which may be outside the EU (only the COPIES stay in the EU); the code and the configuration are deployed from Filarr's Cloudflare account: the commitment, the release chain and the security reviews (internal done, external planned) frame that, not a technical barrier |
| commitment | erasure | a signed receipt proves the service executed the order, not that no copy exists elsewhere |

### Isolation by script, in the same account

The service is a separate Worker script of the same Cloudflare account as Filarr's API, with its own secrets and its
own Durable Objects; the API's script has no binding to them.

- **What that guarantees**: the token is never in clear in the API's database, its backups, its history or an export;
  a flaw or a compromise of the API's CODE (a bug in a route, a poisoned dependency) gives neither the service's
  secrets, nor its storage, nor a token in clear.
- **What it does not cover**: deployment itself, since the service's code and the zone's configuration are deployed
  from that account (the release chain below frames it, not the isolation); and the traffic in transit, which the
  account decrypts as it terminates TLS for the zone. Its certificate is legitimately its own, so this is not visible
  from outside: the commitment and the release chain frame it.

### How a version goes into service

- Only through the integration chain, from a **signed tag** of this public repository; no deployment from a
  workstation.
- A **public log** of releases: version, tag, code fingerprint, publication date, date of entry into service.
- **Seven days** between publication and entry into service, so that anyone can read the code and rebuild its
  fingerprint first (the build is reproducible: see [release.md](release.md)).
- **One exception, the security fix**: a fix to a flaw that puts entrusted databases, their keys, tokens or isolation
  at risk, described in a security advisory of this repository, released by a tag `vX.Y.Z-security` signed by a key of
  the `security` role and naming the advisory. The log then says "security fix, seven-day delay lifted", with the
  advisory and its severity; each hosted access receives the event; the details of the flaw are published within 30
  days. Anything else waits seven days.
- **As of October 27, 2026**, the version in service is 0.3.1; 0.3.2 is published, and its deployment is planned from
  November 3, once its seven days have passed.

### Law

The copies stay in the European Union (Durable Objects in the EU jurisdiction); requests and answers cross, in
transit, the point of presence nearest to the caller. Filarr becomes your processor for the entrusted databases: the [hosted box
DPA annex](https://filarr.com/en/legal/dpa/hosted) comes with the option, Cloudflare listed as sub-processor; the
offer's terms are in § 3a of the [Terms](https://filarr.com/en/legal/terms#section-3-bis), and the
[trust page](https://filarr.com/en/trust#trust-hosted) sums them up.

### Compared with a box at home

| | at home | hosted |
|---|---|---|
| the opened databases stay end-to-end encrypted | yes | no, while entrusted |
| your software's traffic decrypted by Filarr's servers | no | yes, in transit |
| external database keys | in your gate | managed by Filarr's servers |
| something to install and keep running | yes | no |
| PostgreSQL and MySQL syncs | yes | no (HTTPS connectors only) |

### The consent text

What you accept when you entrust databases, word for word (version `hebergement-v1`). `{{box}}` becomes the box's
name. The layout (title, bullets, checkbox) may differ from one app to another; the words may not: each Filarr app is
tested against the SHA-256 fingerprint of this text that the contract fixes, and so is this page (`npm test`). If the
text changes, it takes a new version; without a consent on the current text after 30 days, the database is removed
from the box.

<!-- consent: hebergement-v1 en -->
```text
Entrust these databases to the black box hosted by Filarr?
Today, these databases are end-to-end encrypted: only your devices have their key.
If you entrust them to the black box "{{box}}", hosted by Filarr:
the key of each checked database will be managed by an isolated Filarr service, which decrypts it to answer your software;
while they remain entrusted, these databases are therefore no longer end-to-end encrypted: their rows and columns, including those no view shows, and everything written to them, are decrypted by our servers;
your software's calls and the responses are not end-to-end encrypted either: they go through a filarr.com address, managed by the same account as Filarr's API;
if you connect an external database to it, its key will also be managed by our servers; files the box receives also pass through our servers without end-to-end encryption;
your other databases, your notes, your files and your vaults are not affected.
Filarr commits to not logging this content, to using it only to serve your API, to keeping its copies in the European Union and to erasing the key and the copy when you take it back. These are Filarr's commitments, not protection by end-to-end encryption.
You can take the key back at any time. The keys of these databases then change, and anything written afterwards is end-to-end encrypted again. What the box processed before remains covered by the commitments above.
I understand that the checked databases will no longer be end-to-end encrypted while they are entrusted to Filarr.
