# Release plan

[Lire en français](release.fr.md)

What a release publishes, in which order, and how anyone can check that what was published is what this repository
builds. The first release is **0.2.0**; how the maintainer publishes, step by step: [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## What is published

| artifact | from | where |
|---|---|---|
| `@filarr/gate` (library) | `packages/gate` (`dist/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`) | npm |
| `filarr-gate` (command, server, UI) | `packages/cli` (`dist/cli.js`, `dist/ui/`, READMEs with absolute links, `SECURITY.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`) | npm |
| Docker image | `Dockerfile` | GitHub Container Registry |
| Cloudflare variant | the tagged source (`wrangler.jsonc`, `packages/cloudflare`) | the Deploy button points at the repository |
| checksums and attestations | `SHA256SUMS`, npm provenance, image provenance and SBOM | GitHub release of the tag |

`packages/core`, `packages/server` and `packages/cloudflare` are private: bundled, never published on their own.
`packages/host` (the hosted service) is private too: its module is attached to the GitHub release and goes into
service only through the release chain.

## Versions

One version for the whole repository, set by the maintainer only, in `packages/gate/package.json`,
`packages/cli/package.json` (and the private packages, to keep them aligned). The library reports it as
`lib-<version>` to Filarr, the server as `<version>`. This release: **0.3.1**.

## Before tagging

```sh
git status                    # clean
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test                      # includes the golden vectors, wrangler dev and PostgreSQL when present
npm run test:e2e              # against the local Filarr worker of the Filarr bench (see test/worker.e2e.test.ts)
node scripts/pack-check.mjs release   # builds and packs twice, compares, writes release/SHA256SUMS
```

Also check:

- `packages/core/src/PROVENANCE.json`: the copied core matches the Filarr commit it names (`scripts/copy-core.mjs` run
  against that commit leaves the tree unchanged), and the vectors copied from Filarr are identical to theirs.
- The vectors this repository originates (`source-externe-1`, `gate-fichiers-1`, `gate-settings-1`,
  `gate-heberge-1-gate`) are unchanged, or their change is agreed with the Filarr apps first (parity rule).

## Reproducible builds

- Dependencies are pinned by `package-lock.json` and installed with `npm ci`.
- The bundles (esbuild, Vite) carry no date and no absolute path; `npm pack` writes fixed timestamps and a stable
  order. `scripts/pack-check.mjs` builds and packs twice and fails if the archives differ; run it on two machines (or
  in CI and locally) and compare `SHA256SUMS`.
- The Docker image: the base image is pinned by digest (`NODE_IMAGE` at the top of the `Dockerfile`, which says how to
  update it), the workflow's actions by commit SHA; build with
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set to the tag's commit time (the release workflow does it), with provenance and SBOM. Rewriting
  the layers' timestamps (`--output type=image,rewrite-timestamp=true`) is *to do* once checked on a test push.

## Publishing (in this order)

All of it is `.github/workflows/release.yml`; the step-by-step procedure for the maintainer is
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

1. Tag `v<version>` on `main`, signed with a key of `.github/release-signers` (SSH signature of git).
2. From GitHub Actions only (OIDC, no long-lived token): `npm publish --provenance --access public` of the two
   archives that `scripts/pack-check.mjs` built and compared, `@filarr/gate` then `filarr-gate`. The `prepack` scripts
   copy the licence files into each package.
3. The image, from the same workflow: tags `<version>`, `<major>.<minor>`, `<major>` from 1.0 on, and `latest`
   for a tag of the default branch only (never a maintenance fix),
   signed with cosign (keyless), with its provenance and SBOM.
4. The GitHub release: notes, `SHA256SUMS`, the two `.tgz` archives and the hosted service's module
   (`filarr-gate-host-<version>.js`, built twice and compared like the archives); then the "published" entry of the
   public release journal (branch `release-journal`). The hosted service goes into service later, by hand, from that
   module ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md#the-hosted-service)).
5. Check: `npm view @filarr/gate dist.integrity` against the archive; `npm audit signatures`; `cosign verify` on the
   image; the Deploy button on a test account (never the maintainer's production one).

## Names

- **Image.** `ghcr.io/filarr-work/gate`: `:0.3.1`, `:0.3` (follows the 0.3.x fixes) and `latest`; `:<major>` from
  1.0 on.
- **Volume.** `/data`, as in the Filarr app.
- **npm.** `@filarr/gate` (the library) and `filarr-gate` (the command). If the scope ever changes, what to rename:
  [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md#5-npm-the-filarr-organisation-and-trusted-publishing).
